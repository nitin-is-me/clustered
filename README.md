# Clustered
Clustered is a notes and ideas writing platform, but with a catch:
<br>
The twist is, everyone's notes will be saved at the same place, irrespective of any device. Anyone using this platform can see your notes, and vice versa.
<br>
You can't delete the notes yourself, it's under my control (I thought that's an interesting feature to include).
<br>
You have to enter the note with your name (not necessarily your real name), so that it can be identified
<br>
You can visit the app <a href="https://nitin-is-me.github.io/clustered/">here (hosted on github)</a> or <a href="https://clustered-main.vercel.app/">here (hosted on vercel)</a>

## How it's made
You can check the front end code in this repo, HTML and Javascript is used along with CSS and Bootstrap.
<br>
About backend, I'm hosting the server on Vercel, so you can use the platform 24/7.
<br>
Still if you want to check the backend code, it's available <a href="https://www.github.com/nitin-is-me/clustered-backend">here</a>.
